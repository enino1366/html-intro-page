    <h1>Welcome to my Page</h1>
    <p>My name is Esteban Nino and you have decided to check my page out, many thanks. 
    This page is the first step in my grand plan of making dumb designs work or flop! 
    Whether I succeed isn't a priority, but making silly pages is :D'</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Now, who am I exactly? You've read the name, but not the person. 
        I'm a computer science major with goals of being a software engineer, or even a game developer.
        I am someone who enjoys cooking, reading, and napping throughout the day.
        I'm intersted in fun activities such as watching paint dry, playing games when I can, and listening to music.
    </p>

    <h2>Favorite Tools</h2>
    <p>Useful and great tools I enjoy using:</p>
